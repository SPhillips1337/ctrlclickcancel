# Compilation Instructions for CtrlClickCancel Mod

Since you don't have the standard .NET development tools installed on your system, here are a few options for compiling the mod:

## Option 1: Install .NET SDK or Mono
This is the most straightforward approach for long-term development:

### For .NET SDK:
```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-6.0

# After installation
cd /home/stephen/Documents/rimworld/mods/ctrlclickcancel/Source
dotnet build
```

### For Mono:
```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mono-complete

# After installation
cd /home/stephen/Documents/rimworld/mods/ctrlclickcancel/Source
msbuild CtrlClickCancel.csproj
```

## Option 2: Use Visual Studio on Windows
If you have access to a Windows machine with Visual Studio:

1. Copy the Source folder to your Windows machine
2. Open the CtrlClickCancel.csproj file in Visual Studio
3. Update the reference paths to point to your RimWorld installation
4. Build the project
5. Copy the resulting DLL back to your Linux machine in the Assemblies folder

## Option 3: Use a Docker Container
You can use a Docker container with .NET SDK installed:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /home/stephen/Documents/rimworld/mods/ctrlclickcancel:/app -w /app/Source mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 dotnet build
```

## Option 4: Use an Online C# Compiler
For a quick test, you could use an online C# compiler service, but you would need to simplify the code to remove RimWorld-specific dependencies.

## After Compilation
Once you have the compiled DLL, place it in the Assemblies folder of your mod:
```bash
cp /path/to/compiled/CtrlClickCancel.dll /home/stephen/Documents/rimworld/mods/ctrlclickcancel/Assemblies/
```

Then you can test the mod in RimWorld.
